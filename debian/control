Description: Google Chrome plugin updater/installer
 Downloads and Installs or Upgrades the Pepper Flash and Widevine DRM plugins.
 .
 If a base URL is provided via /etc/default/eos-chrome-plugin-update, this package
 will automatically check for updates of the Chrome plugins there and download them
 if needed, when the machine goes online. If such an URL is not defined, the updater
 behaves differently on amd64 and armhf:
 .
 On amd64, this package will download the Widevine Encrypted Media Extensions
 CDM from Google, and the Pepper Flash Player from Adobe, and make them
 available for use with Chromium.
 .
 On armhf, this package will install the hooks that allow using those plugins if
 present, but it will not download or install anything automatically. Instead, it
 provides a eos-chrome-plugin-update-cros script that can be manually run to install
 the plugins from a ChromeOS image that will be downloaded upon explicit confirmation
 by the user (as it's usually big).
 .
 The end user license agreement is available at Google.
